# 3D-Object-Detection-For-Autonomous-Driving
In this work, we address the problem of 3D object detection from point cloud data in real time. For autonomous vehicles to work, it is very important for the perception component to detect the real world objects with both high accuracy and fast inference.

With the rapid evolution in the world of technology, it becomes increasingly important for the automotive sector to keep up with the fast pace, just like any other industry. In recent times, self-driving cars have gained a lot of traction but there is a huge gap in expectation and the current state. Self Driving Vehicles are one of the most hyped technologies of the modern decade. Even though many companies may brand their driver assistance technology as “Autopilot” a truly self-driving vehicle, without a human driver on open roads, has not yet become a reality.
